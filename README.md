VN
===

VN is the exploration of what it takes to build a simple visual novel engine. At the moment, it currently isn't even that, as it has a hardwired background and no way to change anything.

In the future, there will be a script system so an actual game can be made with the engine, but before then, there's still a load of work to get done.

Intended Features
---

In no particular order;

- Audio - both music and sound effects need to be included
- Script - it won't be much fun making games for this engine if we need to compile everything every time we change something
- Textbox - A basic implementation is in, but this needs work on, including the delay on showing text, and placing characters
- GUI - for system data, such as for saving/loading games, and altering game options
